# Security:
## Auth architecture revolution
### Single server cookie based auth

![Auth version 1](./images/security_singlemachine-cookiebased.png)

### Multi server sticky session based auth
* Cons:
	- Sticky session binds a session to a server. If the server goes down or needs to be maintained. 
	- Sticky session needs to store session data in load balancer. 
* Possible solutions:
	1. Session synchronization by replicating across web servers
	2. Store session data completely inside users' browser
		- Cons: Limited size of cookie
	3. Store session data in a shared storage

### Microservice security


* Auth history: https://time.geekbang.org/course/detail/100031401-111473
	- Cookie / Sticky session / auth service + token
	- JWT based security
	- Staffjoy JWT cookie
* OpenID Connect: Authentication layer
	- id_token: 
* OAuth2: Authorization layer
