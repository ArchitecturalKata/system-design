# Security:
## Auth architecture revolution
### Single server cookie based auth

### Multi server sticky session based auth
* Cons:
	- Sticky session binds a session to a server. If the server goes down or needs to be maintained. 
	- Sticky session needs to store session data in load balancer. 
* Possible solutions:
	1. Session synchronization by replicating across web servers
	2. Store session data completely inside users' browser
		- Cons: Limited size of cookie
	3. Store session data in a shared storage

### Auth Service and token
* Pros:
	- Encapsulate everything related with token issuing
	- Introduce the concept of token, which could be passed around between services
* Cons:
	- Services need to implement the logic to validate the token. 
	- All services need to talk to authSvc, which might become a performance bottleneck. 	
	- All requests need to be verified via auth service.

### Gateway and token
* Pros:
	- Gateway centralizes the logic of parsing userInfo. Only gateway need to validate the token with auth service. 
* Cons:
	- All requests need to be verified via auth service. Auth service needs to be maintained and scaled in a manageable way.

### Gateway and JWT
* Pros:
	- Compact and lightweight
	- Low pressure on Auth server
	- Simplify the implementation of auth server
* Cons:
	- Could not invalidate a JWT token if it has been leaked
	- JWT might become big

## OAuth2

* OpenID Connect: Authentication layer
	- id_token: 
* OAuth2: Authorization layer
